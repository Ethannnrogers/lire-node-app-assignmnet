# lire-node-app-assignmnet

I was assigned a task during my time at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp to develop a node application that took in user commands. 

I used request to retreive user input inside of the command-line, and then served up tweets from a certain user with the
twitter API, or songs with the Spotify API.
